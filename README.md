<!-- Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? -->

## Client:

The Gaming Room

## What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

The part that I felt most conformable with while developing this documentation was the Evaluation part.

## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I definitely found it helpful. Having a Software Spec is great tool to develop without having scope creep and helps to focus on the path.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I were to revise this functional spec I would update the recommendation section. I would improve it by being more thorough when providing recommendations. it is important to note why a recommendation is made and why should the client go with the recommendation with a good understanding of the reasons behind. 

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

First and foremost, when writing a document for the client, we must meet their expectations. It's very important to consider the user's needs because once the software is completed the one that will spend majority of the time utilizing the software are the users. That means we must develop with the users in mind to meet the client expectations.

## How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I must say that moving forward I'd like to always start a project with a Software Spec., the main reason is because a software spec should have everything that the client has requested, thus, it gives us developers a path to follow without having to diverse our focus as we develope.
